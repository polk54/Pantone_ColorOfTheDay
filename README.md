# Pantone Color Of The Day
https://www.pantone.com/colorstrology

The purpose of this project is to create an archive of all of Pantone's "Color of the Day" colors

The DailyScraper_BS.py file scrapes the Color of the Day website to get the Color name, Pantone ID, Hex code, and 3 describing words. The file then opens and appends the text to a .csv called ColorOfTheDay.csv.

Basic site is now set up: https://polk54.github.io/Pantone_ColorOfTheDay/

Now I'm working on automating the process of:
  1. running the Python file everyday
  2. uploading the new .csv to GitHub
  3. having the html reference the .csv and create a new div

Comments and suggestions welcome!
