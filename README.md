# Pantone Color Of The Day
https://www.pantone.com/colorstrology

The purpose of this project is to create an archive of all of Pantone's "Color of the Day" colors

The DailyScraper_BS.py file does the following:
  1. Scrapes the Color of the Day website to get the Color name, Pantone ID, Hex code, and 3 describing words. 
  2. Appends this info to a .csv
  3. Writes this info into a new html section and adds it to index.html

The website is now set up: https://polk54.github.io/Pantone_ColorOfTheDay/

Now I'm working on automating the process of:
  1. Running the python script everday
  2. Pushing the new index.html to GitHub

Comments and suggestions welcome!
