# Pantone Color Of The Day
https://www.pantone.com/colorstrology

The purpose of this project is to create an archive of all of Pantone's "Color of the Day" colors

The DailyScraper_BS.py file scrapes the Color of the Day website to get the Color name, Pantone ID, Hex code, and 3 describing words. The file then opens and appends the text to a .csv called ColorOfTheDay.csv.

I am now working on using this data to create an online repository that displays all this info along with a swatch of the color: https://polk54.github.io/Pantone_ColorOfTheDay/
